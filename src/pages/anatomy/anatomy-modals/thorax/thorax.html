      <h1> <br /> A Honeybee's thorax can be further broken down into 3 main components:<b> the Wings, Legs, and Pollen Baskets. </b></h1>
      <br /> <br />

      <h1> <b>  <u> The Wings </u> </b> </h1> <br />

      <h2> The wings of the Honeybee, aranged in two pairs on the thorax are connected by a row of hooks on the back wing. The
        fore wings are substantially bigger than the hind wings but they both aid in flight. <br /> <br /> The bee is able
        to lift off by giving a propeller like twist to each wing during the up and down strokes. Pulsating muscles located
        in the thorax allow the bee to travel at 15 miles per hour and maintain a range up to three miles from the hive,
        expanding their area of pollination.

      <h1> <b>  <u> The Legs </u> </b> </h1> <br />

      <h2> The Honeybee has three pairs of six segmented legs, these segments mean the legs are very flexible. The front legs
        are specially designed to clean the antennae, the middle set aid in collecting pollen, and the rear set have a special
        secion devoted to pollen collection called a <b>Pollen Basket</b> (See next section). Each leg has claws for gripping
        and sticky pads that assist the bee in landing on slick surfaces. Bees also have taste receptors on the tips of their
        legs. <br /> <br /> The worker bee has a different set of back legs than the other bees in the hive, containing special
        combs and a pollen press. These are used by to brush, collect, pack, and carry pollen and propolis back to the hive.

      <h1> <b>  <u> The Pollen Baskets </u> </b> </h1> <br />

      <h2>The pollen basket is located the bees' hind legs and consists of hairs surrounding a concave region in which the bee
        stores pollen to take back to the hive. When a bee visits a flower, she grooms herself and brushes the pollen sticking
        to her hairy body towards her hind legs. It is at this point that the middle pair of legs packs the pollen into the
        basket. <br /> <br /> To help keep the pollen together during flight, some nectar is mixed in. Finally, the hairs
        on the pollen basket hold it all in place.â€‹
