# Honeybee App  :honeybee:
An educational app designed to inform a user about the honeybee and it's function in the natural world.

## Project Motivation
Created as a working project for an Independant study in Hybrid-Mobile App Development that took place from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018. As of now, this project is added onto in my free time.

## Tools used in the development of this project  :wrench:
- <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic 2</a>
- <a href="https://angular.io">Angular 2</a>

# Project Dependencies
#### I recommend reading all documentation about installation and dependencies before beginning installation.
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>
- <a href="https://angular.io/guide/setup">Angular 2 and dependencies (node.js, npm, RxJS)</a>
- <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/guide/installation.html">Ionic 2 and dependencies (Apache ANT, Java, Android SDK, Cordova)</a>

## Running the project
After cloning the repository, change your current working directory to that of the repository using the command `cd Honeybee-App`

Then run `npm install` to install the rest of the project dependencies. (This will take a minute or two). The result will be a large folder called 'node_modules' appearing in your repository.

Finally run `ionic serve`. This will run the app and display it in a browser window. When the page when it loads you will need to right click and select 'Inspect', then click on the 'Toggle device toolbar' button directly to the right of your 'Elements' header. This will allow you to emulate the resolution and aspect ratio of multiple device types and allow you to more accurately style your application.
